## Saving data

```{r}
#save to disk
iris
#write table function: x is object to write, file = what you want to call it, sep = separate by (delimiter for your file, tab would be "\t")
write.table(x = iris, file = "iris_copy.csv", sep = ",")

#to write text lines to a connection, make notes/a text file:
writeLines("this is my text output", con = "write-lines-example")

#to save the object as is, compressed in memory on your disk: good for saving large files
saveRDS(object = iris, file = "iris_dataframe.rds")

#to pull back from disk: need to save as a variable
iris_from_disk <- readRDS(file = "iris_dataframe.rds")
```
